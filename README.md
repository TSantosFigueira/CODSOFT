# CODSOFT
Machine learning projects developed for the CodSoft Internship Program. I developed three solutions: Credit card fraud detection, Customer churn prediction, and Movie genre classification.

In the first two challenges, I used classification techniques, and faced the ML pipeline involving data preparation, feature selection, and model comparison for best performance.
The last project involved using the movie description to find the respective genre. I used NLP techniques, such as removing stopwords, lemmatizing, and vectorizing the meaningful words. 

The biggest issue with the datasets was class imbalance; I used SMOTE (when possible) to artificially balance the data. The results improved after applying the SMOTE method.
